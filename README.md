# Coom-Gen
This is a bot I made using js its an bot I made for my server so that people can gen account's since I no longer use the bot I thought I could be kind and donate it to you guys so you can possibly learn something from this project. It would be nice for some credit but I know that some people will rename it and give me no credit you could say credits to c0ld or alone and possibly link my github thanks.


How to Install: 
1. First install the bot.
2. Then extract it.
3. Run `npm i` in your cmd
4. Fix the config by using the correct info. Make a bot here: https://discord.com/developers/applications/
5. Start the bot by running `node .` or by doing `node index.js`
6. Enjoy!
